A FAILED status may be accompanied by an error code (errCode), if available.\n\nPARTIAL: A PARTIAL state indicates that a part of a multi-track request has been accomplished, but the full request is incomplete. A PARTIAL status should ultimately be resolved to an end state.\n\nPROPOSED: Indicates that the request was received and alternate collect or contact time(s) (altStartTime, altEndTime) have been proposed. If an alternate is accepted by the requestor the current request should be cancelled and a new request created.\n\nREJECTED: The request has been received and rejected by the provider.
