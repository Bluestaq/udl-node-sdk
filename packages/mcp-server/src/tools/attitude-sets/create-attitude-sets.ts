    "When using this tool, always use the `jq_filter` parameter to reduce the response size and improve performance.\n\nOnly omit if you're sure you don't need the data.\n\nService operation intended for initial integration only. Takes a single AttitudeSet as a POST body and ingest into the database. This operation does not persist any Onorbit Attitude points that may be present in the body of the request. This operation is not intended to be used for automated feeds into UDL. A specific role is required to perform this service operation.  Please contact the UDL team for assistance.\n</br>\nThe following rules apply to this operation:\n<h3>\n * Attitude Set numPoints value must correspond exactly to the number of Onorbit Attitude states associated with that Attitude Set.  The numPoints value is checked against the actual posted number of states and mismatch will result in the post being rejected.\n * Attitude Set startTime and endTime must correspond to the earliest and latest state times, respectively, of the associated Onorbit Attitude states.\n * Either satNo, idOnOrbit, or origObjectId must be provided.  The preferred option is to post with satNo for a cataloged object with (only) origObjectId for an unknown, uncatalogued, or internal/test object.  There are several cases for the logic associated with these fields:\n   + If satNo is provided and correlates to a known UDL sat number then the idOnOrbit will be populated appropriately in addition to the satNo.\n   + If satNo is provided and does not correlate to a known UDL sat number then the provided satNo value will be moved to the origObjectId field and satNo left null.\n   + If origObjectId and a valid satNo or idOnOrbit are provided then both the satNo/idOnOrbit and origObjectId will maintain the provided values.\n   + If only origObjectId is provided then origObjectId will be populated with the posted value.  In this case, no checks are made against existing UDL sat numbers.\n</h3>\n",
